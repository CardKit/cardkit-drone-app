# CardKit Drone App

DroneProtoZero is a sample application showcasing how to program drones with the [DroneCardKit](https://github.com/CardKit/cardkit-drone) framework.

DroneProtoZero is written for iOS in Swift 4.

## Building

DroneProtoZero depends on [CardKit](https://github.com/CardKit/cardkit), the [CardKit Runtime](https://github.com/CardKit/cardkit-runtime), [DroneCardKit](https://github.com/CardKit/cardkit-drone), [DroneTokensDJI](https://github.com/CardKit/cardkit-drone-dji), and [WatsonCardKit](https://github.com/CardKit/cardkit-watson). We use Carthage to manage our dependencies. Run `carthage bootstrap` to build all of the dependencies before building the DroneProtoZero Xcode project.

> ⚠️ DroneProtoZero is very much a prototype app. We do not make any guarantees that it will work out of the box!
